# **Relaxi_Taxi_Game**

this project is the second project of  "Introduction to cellular science".

## whats in:
* In this project I implemented listView, maps, sensors
* In addition to this, there is background music and collision sounds in the project, but they cannot be heard in the clip

## how to play:
on the main screen:
* When high speed is clicked, the game speed is set to 2 times the normal speed
* when you activate sensor mode, the movement buttons disappear and movement to the right and left is by tilting the device
